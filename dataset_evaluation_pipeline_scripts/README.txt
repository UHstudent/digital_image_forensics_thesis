These scripts were used to calculate results using the k-s statistic and absolute median difference for the following datasets containing ground truth masks:

IMD2020
CocoGlide
Columbia
Coverage
IFS training dataset
In the Wild

They are included here as inspiration and guide for anyone who wishes to evaluate these datasets using their own variations/methods.

The "calculate_all_overlap_results.py" file was included for the same reason and this script makes the ROC curves and calculates the overlap result files.
